This is pretty much finished.  You are able to upload images, view them all on the gallery, view individual pages, and view your profiles. 
You may need to refresh the page after logging in.

Currently new profiles cannot be created, but the website does still work if you just create a new login.

I know this is not good practice, but I would recommend just logging in with my user for the best experience.
